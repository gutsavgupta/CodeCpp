/* In this tutorial we will try to focus on operator and operands
 * We will go through many general terms in c++ and will try to 
 * explore as much as possible
 * 
 * Expression:: Sentence formed by one or more operands and evaluates
 *              to some value, eg: variable, built-in literals
 *              More complex Expressions are formed when operators are
 *              involved too
 * 
 * Unary operator   :: Operator that act on single operand      :: ex: *(deref), &
 * Binary operator  :: Operator that act on two operands        :: ex: a*b, a+b, ==
 * ternary operator :: Operator that act on three operand       :: ex  (a)?(b):(c)
 * functions        :: Can operate on infinite operads
 * 
 * Overloaded operators::   When we define the operator functioning as per our class type
 *                          we refer to it as Overloaded Operator.
 *                          However: the number of operands, precedence and associativity
 *                          cannot be changed
 * 
 * Expressions are of two type:
 * 1. lvalue        :: expression which can stand on left-hand side of assignment operator
 * 2. rvalue        :: expression which can stand on right-hand side of assignment operator
 * Roughly speaking :: expression which can result in object or // function ??//
 *                  :: also it depends on usage, const obj are not lvalues
 *                  :: some obj used as rvalue aw well, if used as rvalue, we use value of obj
 *                  :: though if obj are used lvalue we use the object identity (its location in memory)
 * 
 * assignment operator  :: takes left operand as lvalue and right operand as rvalue     :: return lvalue
 * address of operator  :: taked lvaue operand                                          :: return rvalue
 * derefence operator   ::                  ???                                         :: return lvalue
 * 
 * ex: cout << i << " " << i++ << endl;
 * in above example order of evaluation is not garunteed // undefined
 * i++ can evaluate first then i, or vice versa
 * 
 * operator that garuntees evaluatio order
 * &&, ||, ?:, ','\comma, 
 * 
 * f() + g()*h() + x()
 * 
 * precendence      --> garuntees that g()*h() is done
 * associativity    --> garuntees that f() is added to g()*h() then added to x()
 * eval. order      --> is not garunteed
 * 
 * Note: arithmetic operators have L associativity
 *       uniary(+,-) > (*,/,%) > (+,-)
 *       data type are promted in arithmetic expression
 *       works on arithmetic operands or pointers
 * 
 * Logical Operator::
 * takes operands of type bool or can be converted in type bool
 * return operands of type bool; arithmetic and pointer with 0 --> false, rest --> true
 * return rvalue, requires rvalue
 * 
 * logical OR and AND --> Short-circuit evaluation
 * operator ! has R associativity
 * rest other logical operator has L associativity
 * 
 * a != c < d
 * same as: a != (c<d)
 * 
 * Compound expressions are better/effcient in term of execution
 * operand is evaluated once as compared to normal assignment (where
 * operands are evaluated twice) 
 * 
 * Note:
 * ++a :: prefix operator has lower precendence
 *        increment the variable and return the lvalue/reference
 *        to the same variable
 * a++ :: postfix operator has higer precedence, increment the 
 *        value, return copy of (rvalue) previous value
 * 
 * Member Access
 * obj.mem  :: (.) operator high precedence
 * ptr->Mem :: ->  arrow operator high precedence
 * (*ptr).mem :: (*) derefence and dot, although derefence has lower precedence
 * (*ptr.mem) :: this means derefence mem obj of ptr class --> *(ptr.mem)
 * arrow operator -> yeilds an lvalue always
 * dot operator (.) yeilds lvalue from lvalue object, otherwise r value
 * 
 * ?: conditonal operator is of low precedence
 * of the order of "=", "*=", "+="..execution
 * should be used mostly with parenthesesi
 * cout << str.size()<60 ? "small" : "large" << endl ; // huge blunder
 * ((cout << str.size()) < 60) ? small : (large << endl);
 * 
 * BITWISE operator promotes small init to larger type first
 * then apply 
 * Recomendation --> better to use unsigned bit with bit operator
 * 
 * THE SIZEOF Operator ::
 * sizeof(type) --> return size of type in bytes, return-type constexpr size_t
 * sizeof(expr) --> return size of type of exprs
 * 
 * sizeof operator is evaluted at compile time and has no 
 * rum time evaluation reqiuirement (this can be validated from the fact that
 * c++ is statically typed language i.e at compile time ,, all variables types
 * are fixed)
 * 
 * Comma operator ','
 * 1. very low precedence, actually lowest
 * 2. gaurentees evaluation order
 * 3. Associativy L
 * expr1 , expr2
 * expr1 is evaluated before expr2 
 * return --> right hand_expression
 *        --> return lvalue if right hand expression is lvalue
 * 
 * ## Implicit Conversion
 * Apart from Airthmetic Implicit conversion
 * Array are also converted to pointer to first element when used in
 * expression, except decltype(), sizeof(), type-id, and when assiging 
 * refrences
 * 
 * auto &a = arr; a will of type (arr)[]
 * 
 * Pointers of non-const type are converted to void* Implicit
 * all pointers can be converted to const void*
 * 0, nullptr can be converted to any pointer type
 * 
 * Classes can specify automatic conversion 
 * ex: while(cin) cin --> gets converted into bool Implicitly
 * ex: string a = "hello", c-style string converted to string_type
 * 
 * ## Explicit conversion
 * cast     ::  for Explicitly converting type in c
 * Warning: ::  although required some time, cast are inherently dangerous
 * 
 *  # Named-cast    ::  cast-name<type>(expression)
 *  1.  static_cast<>
 *  2.  dynamic_cast<>
 *  3.  const_cast<>
 *  4.  reinterpret_cast<>
 *  if the type is reference the result is lvalue, else rvalue
 *  the cast-name determines what kind of conversion shall be performed
 * 
 *  # static_cast<>
 *  any well-defined cast excluding low-level const can be performed using 
 *  static_cast<>, it indicates that the conversion is intentional and well-thought
 *  static_cast<> can cast void* ptr to any ptr
 *  and const void* to any const ptr
 *  static_cast is the first cast you should attempt to use. 
        // It does things like implicit conversions between types (such as int to float, 
        // or pointer to void* or vice versa), and it can also call explicit conversion 
        // functions (or implicit ones)
 * 
 *  # reinterpret_cast<> 
 *  is the most dangerous cast, and should be used very sparingly. 
 *  It turns one type directly into another â€” such as casting the value from one pointer 
 *  to another, or storing a pointer in an int, or all sorts of other nasty things
 * 
 *  C-Style cast
 *  (T)expression OR
 *  T(expression)
 *  both are same
 * 
 *  C-style cast tries below in order
 *  1. If Static_cast<> is possible
 *  2. If Const_cast<> is possible
 *  3. If dynamic_cast<> is possible
 *  4. reinterpret_cast<> // fails for only some case
