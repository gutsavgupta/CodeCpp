# Circular Queue Implementation

## Algorithm
The Circular Queue is an efficient implementation of an queue data structure while keeping the space constraint. It aims to provide functionality such as enqueue and dequeue supporting all type of data structure, since it uses template<class type>. 

## Function
Currently 3 main function is been incorporated in the code

1. push(data_type val)
2. pop()
3. init queue(int size)

Security and other vunerabilities are still there, and I will be working to fix most of them, till then feel free to contibute.
