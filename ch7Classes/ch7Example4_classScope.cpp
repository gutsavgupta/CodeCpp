 * Note: Once the class name is seen, the remainder of the definition—including 
 *       the parameter list and the function body—is in the scope of the class. 
 *       As a result, we can refer to other class members without qualification
 *
 * Note: Member function definitions are processed after the compiler processes
 *       all of the declarations in the class.

 *       Definitions of type names usually should appear at the beginning of a class. 
 *       That way any member that uses that type will be seen after the type name
 *       has already been defined.
 *
 *       Even though the class member is hidden, it is still possible to use that
 *       member by qualifying the member’s name with the name of its class or by
 *       using the this pointer explicitly.
